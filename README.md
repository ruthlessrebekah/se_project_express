# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

## Features Implemented (Sprint 12 and Beyond)

### Schemas & Models

- User schema: `name` (2-30 chars, required), `avatar` (required, URL validated), `email` (unique, validated), `password` (hashed, hidden from queries)
- ClothingItem schema: `name` (2-30 chars, required), `weather` (enum: 'hot', 'warm', 'cold'), `imageUrl` (required, URL validated), `owner` (ObjectId ref to User), `likes` (array of ObjectId refs to User), `createdAt` (default: Date.now)

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication for protected routes
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Only item owners can delete their own clothing items (403 error for unauthorized deletes)
- User profile management: `GET /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me`

### Routes & Controllers

- Users:
  - `POST /signup` — create user (validates required fields, hides password in response)
  - `POST /signin` — login (validates required fields, returns JWT)
  - `GET /users/me` — get current user
  - `PATCH /users/me` — update current user
- Clothing Items:
  - `GET /items` — get all items
  - `POST /items` — create item (owner set to current user)
  - `DELETE /items/:itemId` — delete item (only owner can delete)
  - `PUT /items/:itemId/likes` — like item
  - `DELETE /items/:itemId/likes` — unlike item

### Middleware & Error Handling

- Centralized error codes in `utils/errors.js` (`BAD_REQUEST`, `NOT_FOUND`, `FORBIDDEN`, `SERVER_ERROR`)
- Controllers return JSON error messages with correct status codes
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- All validation and authorization errors return appropriate status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

### Other

- All routes and controllers tested for expected status codes and response formats
- All endpoints return JSON objects with relevant data or error messages
- Postman tests for validation, authorization, and error handling
